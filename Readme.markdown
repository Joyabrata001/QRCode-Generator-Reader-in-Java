## Different Folders
1. **QRCodes**: 
   - Destination folder of all QR codes generated by **QrCodeGeneratorDemo.java**
   - This is also used as source folder of all QR codes that need to be read by **QrCodeReaderDemo.java**
2. **ExtractedInfo**: 
   - Destination folder of extracted information of all QR codes by **QrCodeReaderDemo.java**
   - For the file **QRCodes/QRimage.png**, reader creates **ExtractedInfo/QRimage_extracted.txt**
